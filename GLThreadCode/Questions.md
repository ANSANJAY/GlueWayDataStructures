# GL Threads Interview Q&A :question: :memo:

Hello there! :wave: If you're looking to get up to speed with Generic Linked Threads (GL Threads), you've come to the right place! This document is intended to cover frequently asked interview questions related to GL Threads and their implementations. Let's get started! :rocket:

### What is a GL Thread? :question:

**Answer**: A GL Thread (Generic Linked Thread) is a kind of data structure similar to a doubly-linked list. However, it is more flexible and generic. It is implemented to hold any kind of data object and not just integers or simple data types. :bulb:

---

### What is the purpose of the `offset` in `glthread_t`? :question:

**Answer**: The `offset` in `glthread_t` helps you locate the beginning of the data object from its node in the GL Thread. In traditional doubly-linked lists, you can use the `data` pointer directly to access the data. However, in GL Threads, you need to subtract this `offset` from the address of the node to get a pointer to the start of the data object. :point_left:

### How is a node removed from a GL Thread? :question:

**Answer**: Node removal in GL Threads is quite similar to that in traditional doubly-linked lists. You need to call an API function like `glthread_remove()` which takes a pointer to the node to be removed as an argument. The function will then adjust the pointers of the adjacent nodes to remove the target node. :scissors:

---

### What is the time complexity for node removal in GL Thread? :question:

**Answer**: The time complexity for node removal from a GL Thread is \( O(1) \), just like in traditional doubly-linked lists. This is because you only need to update the pointers of the adjacent nodes, which is a constant time operation. :alarm_clock:

---

### How do you iterate over GL Threads? :question:

**Answer**: You can use the `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_BEGIN` and `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_ENDS` macros to iterate over the nodes of a GL Thread. These macros allow you to perform operations on each node's data during the iteration. To get to the actual data object from its node, you need to use the `offset` to calculate its address. :loop:

That's all folks! :clap: I hope this helps you get a better grasp of GL Threads. Good luck on your interviews! :four_leaf_clover:

# Technical Interview Questions on GLThread Code ðŸ¤“

## Questions about `glthread.h`:

1. **Question**: What is the purpose of `glthread_node_t` structure in `glthread.h`?
   **Answer**: The `glthread_node_t` structure is the basic building block for creating doubly-linked list nodes. It contains two pointers `left` and `right` that point to the previous and next nodes, respectively.

2. **Question**: Explain the macro `offsetof` used in `glthread.h`. How is it used in this implementation?
   **Answer**: The `offsetof` macro is used to find the byte offset of a member within a structure. It's used to initialize the `offset` field of a `glthread_t` structure, helping to correlate the actual data structure with its glthread_node.

3. **Question**: Describe the role of `glthread_add` and `glthread_remove` functions as declared in `glthread.h`.
   **Answer**: The `glthread_add` function is used to add a new node to the generalized linked list (GLThread), and `glthread_remove` is used to remove a node from it.

## Questions about `glthread.c`:

4. **Question**: How does the `_glthread_add_next` function work internally?
   **Answer**: The `_glthread_add_next` is a private helper function that inserts a `new_node` right after `curr_node` in the list. It takes care of adjusting `left` and `right` pointers for seamless addition.

5. **Question**: Why are we using a static function `_remove_glthread`?
   **Answer**: The `_remove_glthread` function is static because it is intended to be a helper function that's only visible within the file. It performs the node removal operation but does not handle list-specific details like updating the head of the list.

6. **Question**: What does the `init_glthread` function do?
   **Answer**: The `init_glthread` function initializes a `glthread_t` object by setting its `head` to `NULL` and initializing its `offset`.

## Questions about `main.c`:

7. **Question**: What is the role of `emp_t` structure in `main.c`?
   **Answer**: The `emp_t` structure defines an employee with attributes like name, salary, designation, and emp_id. It also includes a `glthread_node_t` object for linking into the GLThread.

8. **Question**: Describe the purpose of `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_BEGIN` and `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_ENDS` in the main function.
   **Answer**: These macros facilitate the traversal of the generalized linked list. They initialize pointers and handle the iteration from the beginning to the end of the list.

9. **Question**: What steps are taken to free up all dynamically allocated memory?
   **Answer**: A final `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_BEGIN` loop is used to go through each node, remove it from the list using `glthread_remove`, and then free its memory using `free()`. Finally, `emp_list` itself is freed.

Feel free to answer these questions as you would in an actual technical interview. ðŸ˜Š
