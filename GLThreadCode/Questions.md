# GL Threads Interview Q&A :question: :memo:

Hello there! :wave: If you're looking to get up to speed with Generic Linked Threads (GL Threads), you've come to the right place! This document is intended to cover frequently asked interview questions related to GL Threads and their implementations. Let's get started! :rocket:

### What is a GL Thread? :question:

**Answer**: A GL Thread (Generic Linked Thread) is a kind of data structure similar to a doubly-linked list. However, it is more flexible and generic. It is implemented to hold any kind of data object and not just integers or simple data types. :bulb:

### What is the purpose of the `offset` in `glthread_t`? :question:

**Answer**: The `offset` in `glthread_t` helps you locate the beginning of the data object from its node in the GL Thread. In traditional doubly-linked lists, you can use the `data` pointer directly to access the data. However, in GL Threads, you need to subtract this `offset` from the address of the node to get a pointer to the start of the data object. :point_left:

### How is a node removed from a GL Thread? :question:

**Answer**: Node removal in GL Threads is quite similar to that in traditional doubly-linked lists. You need to call an API function like `glthread_remove()` which takes a pointer to the node to be removed as an argument. The function will then adjust the pointers of the adjacent nodes to remove the target node. :scissors:

---

### What is the time complexity for node removal in GL Thread? :question:

**Answer**: The time complexity for node removal from a GL Thread is \( O(1) \), just like in traditional doubly-linked lists. This is because you only need to update the pointers of the adjacent nodes, which is a constant time operation. :alarm_clock:

---

### How do you iterate over GL Threads? :question:

**Answer**: You can use the `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_BEGIN` and `ITERATE_GL_THREADS_ENDS` macros to iterate over the nodes of a GL Thread. These macros allow you to perform operations on each node's data during the iteration. To get to the actual data object from its node, you need to use the `offset` to calculate its address. :loop:

That's all folks! :clap: I hope this helps you get a better grasp of GL Threads. Good luck on your interviews! :four_leaf_clover:
