# Interview Revision Notes on Node Removal in GL Threads 🗑️🔗

## Introduction 🎉
In this segment, we'll cover how to remove a node from a GL thread, which is quite straightforward. You'll find that this process is nearly identical to removing a node from a traditional doubly-linked list.

---

## Objective 🎯
- To implement an API called `thread_remove` that takes a pointer to the node to be removed as its argument.
- To understand the time complexity involved in node removal from a GL thread and a traditional doubly-linked list.

---

## Implementation 🛠

### Removing a Node from a Traditional Doubly Linked List 📝
In a traditional doubly-linked list, if you have a pointer to the node that needs to be removed, you simply adjust the pointers of its left and right neighbors to remove it. 

### Removing a Node from a GL Thread 📝
- In the case of a GL thread, you follow the exact same approach as above.
- Use the API `thread_remove` and pass the pointer to the node that needs to be removed.

### Time Complexity ⏰
- The time complexity for node removal from a doubly-linked list or a GL thread is \(O(1)\), i.e., constant time.

## Comparison with Traditional Doubly Linked Lists 🔍

### Key Similarities 👯‍♂️
- Node removal in GL threads and traditional doubly-linked lists is identical.
- Both operations are simple and straightforward, and both have a time complexity of \(O(1)\).

---

## Summary 🌟
1. Node removal in GL threads is exactly the same as in traditional doubly-linked lists.
2. Use the `thread_remove` API to remove a node from a GL thread.
3. The time complexity for this operation is \(O(1)\) in both cases.

---

## Key Takeaways 🎓
- Node removal in GL threads is straightforward and identical to that in traditional doubly-linked lists.
- Always remember that the time complexity is \(O(1)\), making this a fast operation.
