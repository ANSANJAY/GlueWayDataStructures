# GlueWayDataStructures
Explore the 'Glue Way' of organizing general-purpose data structures like linked lists, queues, and trees. This repository provides a deep dive into glued libraries, showcasing their advantages over traditional libraries. Perfect for understanding how modern industry standards, including the Linux kernel, implement data structures.

# 📝  Glue Way of Organizing Data Structures

## 📌 Introduction

### 🎯 Objective
To study the "Glue Way" of organizing data structures.

### 🛠 Types of Data Structures
Includes linked lists, queues, and trees.

### 💡 Goal
To redesign and organize these general-purpose data structures using the "glue" concept.

## 📑 What is the Glue Way?

### 🔄 Redefining Libraries
Changing how libraries like .h and .c files are structured.

### 🆕 Traditional vs Glued Libraries
Till now, you've been using traditional libraries. The course proposes a shift to glued libraries.

### 📊 Scope
The glue concept is applicable to multiple types of data structures, not just linked lists.

## 🌟 Benefits of Using Glued Libraries

### 🐧 Linux Kernel
Glued libraries are used in Linux kernel code.

### 📈 Industry Adoption
Easier to find glued libraries in use than traditional ones.

### 🎁 Advantages
Glued libraries offer certain benefits over traditional libraries which will be discussed further.

## 📚 Example: Glue Threads (GL Threads)

### 🏷 Naming
The glued version of the doubly linked list will be called GL Threads.

### 📏 What are GL Threads?
GL stands for "glue" and threads is often an industry term for linked lists as they are linear like threads.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives

### 🎨 Redesign the Traditional Library
Convert the .h and .c files into a glued version.

### 🤔 Understanding the Advantages
Know when to use glued libraries over traditional libraries.

### 🛠 Practical Application
Learn to apply the glue concept to other data structures like trees, stacks, and queues.
