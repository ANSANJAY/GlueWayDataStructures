# 📚 GL Threads - Understanding Glued Version of Doubly Linked Lists 

## 📌 Introduction

### 🎯 Objective
GL Threads are a glued version of traditional doubly linked lists, designed to reorganize data structures in a more efficient way.

## 🔄 Traditional Doubly Linked Lists vs GL Threads

### 💡 Recap of Traditional Doubly Linked Lists
- 🏷 **Node Structure**: A typical node of a traditional doubly linked list has three members - `left`, `right`, and `data`.
- 📚 **List Structure**: Represents the doubly linked list itself.

### 🆕 Introduction to GL Threads
- 🏷 **Node Structure**: Contains only `left` and `right` members, no `data`.
- 📚 **List Structure**: Has a `pointer` to the head of the thread and also has a unique `offset` member.

## 🤔 What's Missing in GL Threads?

### ❌ Absence of `data` Member
- In traditional nodes, the `data` member points to application data.
- This `data` member is not present in GL Thread nodes.

### 🎓 Why is `data` Member Absent?
- To be discussed shortly.

## 📊 Features of GL Threads

### ⚙ Functional Pointers
- Like traditional lists, GL Threads can also have function pointers.

### 📏 Offset Member
- A unique feature in GL Threads is the `offset` member.
- The purpose and usage of this will be discussed.

## ❓ Curiosities About GL Threads

### 🤷‍♂️ How Do GL Threads Hold Application Data?
- Since GL Threads lack a `data` member, how do they handle application data?
- This point will be explored after diving deeper into some C concepts.
