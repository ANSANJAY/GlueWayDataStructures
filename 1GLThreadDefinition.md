# 📚 GL Threads - Understanding Glued Version of Doubly Linked Lists 

## 📌 Introduction

### 🎯 Objective
GL Threads are a glued version of traditional doubly linked lists, designed to reorganize data structures in a more efficient way.

---

## 🔄 Traditional Doubly Linked Lists vs GL Threads

### 💡 Recap of Traditional Doubly Linked Lists
- 🏷 **Node Structure**: A typical node of a traditional doubly linked list has three members - `left`, `right`, and `data`.
- 📚 **List Structure**: Represents the doubly linked list itself.

### 🆕 Introduction to GL Threads
- 🏷 **Node Structure**: Contains only `left` and `right` members, no `data`.
- 📚 **List Structure**: Has a `pointer` to the head of the thread and also has a unique `offset` member.

## 🤔 What's Missing in GL Threads?

### ❌ Absence of `data` Member
- In traditional nodes, the `data` member points to application data.
- This `data` member is not present in GL Thread nodes.

## 📊 Features of GL Threads

### ⚙ Functional Pointers
- Like traditional lists, GL Threads can also have function pointers.

### 📏 Offset Member
- A unique feature in GL Threads is the `offset` member

#  Revision Notes on GL Threads vs Traditional Doubly Linked Lists 📘

## Introduction 🌟

This document focuses on understanding the differences between GL Threads and traditional doubly linked lists. It's tailored to prepare you for interviews that might ask questions related to this topic.

## Concept Overview 🌐

### What are GL Threads? 🤔

- GL Threads are a "glued" version of traditional doubly linked lists.
- They serve the same purpose as traditional doubly linked lists but are organized differently for efficiency.

### Structures in Traditional Doubly Linked List and GL Threads 🛠️

#### Traditional Doubly Linked List 📚

- **Node structure**: Contains three members `left`, `right`, and `data`. 
- **List structure**: Usually contains a `head` pointer.

#### GL Threads 📚

- **GL Node structure**: Contains only two members `left` and `right`.
- **Thread structure**: Similar to the traditional structure but adds an `offset` member.

## Interview Questions and Answers 🎤💡

### Q1: What is the purpose of GL Threads? 🎯

**Answer**: 
The purpose of GL Threads is the same as traditional doubly linked lists, which is to organize data efficiently. However, GL Threads are designed to do this in a more efficient way than traditional doubly linked lists.

---

### Q2: Can you explain the structural difference between a node in a traditional doubly linked list and a node in GL Threads? 🏗️

**Answer**: 
In a traditional doubly linked list, each node has three members: `left`, `right`, and `data`, where `data` is a pointer to the application data. In GL Threads, the node (known as GL Node) only has two members: `left` and `right`. There is no `data` member in GL Nodes.

---

### Q3: What is the role of the `offset` member in GL Threads? 🤷‍♀️

**Answer**: 
The `offset` member is unique to GL Threads and serves a specific purpose in how GL Threads manage data. 

---

### Q4: How do GL Threads hold application data if there is no `data` member? 📦

**Answer**: 
GL Threads are designed in such a way that they don't need a separate `data` member to hold the application data. The data is directly integrated into the structure of the GL Threads, making it more memory efficient.

---

### Q5: Can you have function pointers in GL Threads, similar to traditional doubly linked lists? 🖱️

**Answer**: 
Yes, like traditional doubly linked lists, GL Threads can also have function pointers. This allows for a similar level of extensibility and functionality.
